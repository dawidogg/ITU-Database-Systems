	| Source                | Source of this data. "OurAirports" for data sourced from OurAirports, "Legacy" for old data not matched to OurAirports (mostly DAFIF), "User" for unverified user contributions. In airports.csv, only source=OurAirports is included. |

	| Alias      | Alias of the airline. For example, All Nippon Airways is commonly known as "ANA".    |
	| IATA       | 2-letter IATA code, if available.                                                    |

	| Country    | Country or territory where airport is located. See Countries to cross-reference to ISO 3166-1 codes. |
	| Active     | "Y" if the airline is or has until recently been operational, "N" if it is defunct. This field is not reliable: in particular, major airlines that stopped flying long ago, but have not had their IATA code reassigned (eg. Ansett/AN), will incorrectly show as "Y". |
