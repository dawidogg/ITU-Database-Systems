* Introduction
  As our term project for the Database Systems course, we developed an interactive traveling cost estimation application. User can choose their start location and destination city on an interactive map, indicate the number of days, and an estimated cost of their travel including plane tickets and daily expenses is presented. The technology stack of this project is quite complex, requiring a database management system, server and client sides. 
  
* Software used
** Database
   MySQL is an open-source relational database management system, having support for all devices and operating systems. It is lightweight, easy to operate, and due to its popularity there are MySQL extensions for integrated development environments, or even dedicated graphical programs. During development, we mostly used MySQL Workbench and the terminal version of MySQL client.
   Some functions in the database, as well as integration with an HTTP server required some customization. After installing MySQL, the following commands must be run inside the command-line client:

#+begin_src sql
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<R00tUser>';
mysql> SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
mysql> SET GLOBAL sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY',''));
#+end_src

   The Flush Privileges statement reloads the grant tables' privileges, ensuring that any changes made to user permissions are immediately applied without requiring a restart of the MySQL server. This is totally optional in our case; however, it is a good general practice. The second line contains authentication data, so that the backend server can connect to the databse. The user name is set to "root", trusted address is "localhost" or "127.0.0.1", and password is "<R00tUser>". Connecting with these credentials gives full control over the database. The last two lines became necessary because some database queries and functions, important to our application, would not have worked otherwise. 

** Server
   Initially, we thought of using Flask, which is a micro web framework written in Python. However, it had no apparent advantages over other frameworks when it comes to work with databases. Since the client side works with JavaScript, we decided to stick to this language and used it in the backend as well. Running JavaScript without a browser is possible with Node.js, an open-source runtime enviroment built on top of Google Chrome's V8 engine.
   In order to run the server, Node.js must be installed. Then, inside the *express_server* directory, *npm install* must be run from terminal. This command will install all of necessary dependencies:
   - *express*: Node.js server framework for building web applications and APIs.
   - *nodemon*: Development tool for hot-reloading Node.js applications during code changes.
   - *mysql2*: Module for interacting with MySQL databases.
   - *dotenv*: Loads environment variables from a .env file, instead of hard coding credentials.
   - *shelljs*: Executes external programs and shell commands.
   - *cors*: Provides Cross-Origin Resource Sharing support.
   - *bcrypt*: Encrypts passwords securely.
   After this installation, the server can be started on *localhost:8080* with the command *npm start*.

** Client
   The client code is located in *react_app* directory, and as its name suggests, it is build using React.js front-end library. In the same way as with the server, *npm install* will download all necessary packages:
   - *react-router-dom*: A package used for page navigation in React applications.
   - *react-helmet*: A package that allows for dynamically changing the title of a webpage.
   - *react-native*: Primarily used for developing mobile applications using the React Native framework.
   - *react-native-web*: Enables the use of React Native components in web applications.
   - *react-horizontal-scrolling-menu*: Provides a horizontally scrolling menu component.
   - *leaflet*: Used for creating interactive maps in web applications.
   - *react-leaflet*: Offers React components specifically designed for working with maps in web applications.
   *npm start* command opens the application inside the default browser running at *localhost:3000*.

* Database
** Database sources
   Most of the tables in database come from OpenFlights.org. It contains *airlines.csv*, *airports.csv*, *countries.csv*, *routes.csv* and *planes.csv* files. The second source, which was supposed to be used for staying cost estiamation, was Numbeo's /Current Cost of Living Index/. It compares cities across the world by several parameters, such as rent, groceries, restaurant and local purchasing power indeces. Lastly, the *airlines.csv* from the first database is augumented with /Airline Logos/ database, which has over 900 airline logos in PNG format. These datasets can be accessed from the links below:
   - https://openflights.org/data.html                                     
   - https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_current.jsp             
   - https://github.com/sexym0nk3y/airline-logos                         
** Importing from CSV
   By first running *SCHEMA.sql* and then *IMPORT.sql*, assuming that the CSV files were copied to the path accessible to MySQL, all required tables can be imported. *IMPORT.sql* also has a function for randomly generating a table called *airline_costs*.

** Table row descriptions
   According to the table row descriptions provided in this section, *SCHEMA.sql* was written.

** Entity Relationship Diagram
  In total, there are 9 tables, interconnected in such a way:
   [[./report/images/erdiagram.png]]

* Backend API
** SQL scripts
*** Closest airport to point
  #+begin_src sql
delimiter $$

create function closest_airport(p_lat double, p_long double) returns int
deterministic
begin
return (select id
        from airports
        order by ST_Distance_Sphere(
        point(longitude, latitude), 
        point(p_long, p_lat)
        ) limit 1);
end$$
delimiter ;  
  #+end_src

*** Map
  #+begin_src sql
select id, latitude as lat, longitude as lng, name
from airports     
where id = closest_airport(47, 28.9);
  #+end_src

*** Distance between airports
    The script creates a function which takes two airport identifiers (a and b) and returns the geographic distance between them. *ST_Distance_Sphere(Point, Point)* is MySQL's native function for calculating distance between geographic points. Given latitude and longitude as double-precision values, they can transformed into *Point* data type using *point(long, lat)* function. Because all that is given is airport IDs, their corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates are retrieved using the *SELECT* statement.
  #+begin_src sql
delimiter $$
create function distance_between_airports(a int, b int) returns int
begin
return (select ST_Distance_Sphere(
point((select longitude from airports where id = a), (select latitude from airports where id = a)),
point((select longitude from airports where id = b), (select latitude from airports where id = b))              
)); 
end$$
delimiter ; 
  #+end_src    

*** Calculate indirect routes and show all details
    The following script is quite long and it generates results with a noticeable delay. However, its output represents a very rich information, specifically the list of direct and indirect routes. It outputs airport IDs that are part of the route, city and country names where airports are located and the route's total distance.

    First, the script generates an /intermediate/ table inside the *WITH* clause. Regardless of the number of stops, all routes are in the same table of 5 columns: *a0*, *a1*, *a2*, *a3* and *distance*, where *ax* is airport *x*'s identifier. For direct flights, only two airport IDs will be shown, and the places for other airports will get an invalid value, -1. This is done using *CASE* expressions. The number of airports is always at least two, so there is nothing to be checked for *a0* and *a1*. For *a2*, the ID is irrelevant when the route ends on airport 1. The case expression for *a2* can be read like this: in case when the destination airport has been found at level 0 (direct flight), then *a2* is irrelevant and takes -1; otherwise, the airport found at level 1 (indirect flight with 1 exchange) is relevant. For *a3* to be included, airports found at level 0 and level 1 must not be equal to final destination. *a3* is the result of level 2 evaluation (indirect flight with 2 exhanges).

    The last column is distance, which is calculated again according to the relevancy of airport IDs. The *CASE* expression switches between different formulas. When all airport IDs are relevant, distances between all adjacent points are include, and when the flight is direct, the total distance is the distance between two airports. Distance is important in sorting rows, because shortest paths are usually cheaper and more relevant.

    Different levels are obtained by joining the *routes* table onto itself two times. *lvl0* instance is left-joined with *routes* to create *lvl1*, which is again left-joined with another *routes* instance, resulting in *lvl2*. Out of this big table, the only rows relevant are those which lead to *@destination*, on any level.

    Since irrelevant airports are hidden with -1, there can be multiple same rows. To handle this issue, *SELECT DISTINCT* is used. The rows are ordered by distance and are limited, because there can be too many results.

    In second part, the intermediate table is expanded with city and country names of each stop. This final version is what the web application will show to the user: routes consisting of readable sequences of cities and countries.

*** Get airlines data from route
    This script works on results obtained from the indirect routes script. It gets the list of airline names, ICAO codes and cost category numbers, for a pair of airports. This script is not combined with already hefty route finding script, it is instead used by the backend server. The backend program has more control and is able to select only a portion of routes, thus limiting the quickly growing airline list.
  #+begin_src sql
select airlines.name, airlines.icao, airline_costs.category
from routes, airlines, airline_costs
where airlines.id = routes.airline_id and
      airline_costs.id = routes.airline_id and
      routes.src_airport_id=344 and
      routes.dest_airport_id=1688;
  #+end_src

*** Get user history
    The user should be able to access their own history data in the account page, and this script is exactly for this. It prepares the data in a readable format, with origin and destination columns being in "CITY, COUNTRY" format, containing the number of days, cost and even the time stamp formatted nicely. In this way, every piece of data the database holds is provided, respecting the users' freedom.
  #+begin_src sql
select CONCAT(src.city, ", ", src.country) as origin,
       CONCAT(dest.city, ", ", dest.country) as destination,
       days, cost, date_format(time_stamp, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s') as "time_stamp"

** Wrapper functions
   On top of the SQL scripts described above, the backend API uses some trivial select and insert commands, which were omitted. However, the shorter scripts can be still mentioned in the context of wrapper functions. *express_server/database.js* is the file were all communication between the backend and MySQL server takes place. It connects to the database using environmental variables inside *express_server/.env*:
   #+begin_src js
MYSQL_USER='root'
MYSQL_HOST='localhost'
MYSQL_PASSWORD='<R00tUser>'
MYSQL_DATABASE='traveling_cost'
   #+end_src
   Instead of keeping only one connection, *database.js* creates a /pool/ of connections using these credentials, which allows more flexible querying. Every query function is structured similar to this example:
   #+begin_src js
export async function getCityCountry(airport_id) {
    try {
        const [result] = await pool.query(
            `select city, country from airports
            where id = ?`,
            airport_id
        );
        return result;
    } catch(e) {
        console.log(e.message);
        return false;
    }      
}
   #+end_src
   Some functions retrieve or post user's sensitive data, and additional checks must be performed to confirm the someone's identity. Before that, let's have a look at a new user creation. This function check for the password length, hashes the password and inserts everything to the database:
   #+begin_src js
export async function newUser(user_data) {
    if (user_data[1].length < 5)
        throw new Error("Password shorter than 5 characters");
    const hashed_password = await hashPassword(user_data[1]);
    const [result] = await pool.query(
        `insert into users values
    (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);`,
        [user_data[0], hashed_password, user_data[2], user_data[3],
         parseInt(user_data[4]), parseInt(user_data[5])]
    );
    return result;
}
   #+end_src
   Then, there is a login function, used to verify someone's identity. The password provided is hashed and compared with the one in the database:
   #+begin_src js
export async function login(login_data) {
    const [[result]] = await pool.query(
        `select password_hash from users where email=?;`,
        login_data[0]
    );
    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(login_data[1], result["password_hash"]);
    return isMatch;
}
   #+end_src

   Finally, each function that accesses, uploads or deletes user's private data goes through the authentification process, as in this example:
   #+begin_src js
export async function getUser(login_data) {
    const authentificated = await login(login_data);
    if (authentificated) {
        const [[result]] = await pool.query(
            `select email, first_name, last_name, age, interests
             from users where email=?;`,       
            login_data[0]
        );
        return result;
    }
}
   #+end_src

    The biggest function in the *express_server/database.js* is *getPlaneOffers(source_id, destination_id)*. It calls the indirect route calculation script, and as long as the number of saved offers is not exceeded, each route gets expanded into concrete offers by airlines. For direct flights, there is no limit, but for indirect ones there is a limit of 5 + 5 offers (for one exchange and two exchanges). The selection of indirect flights is done randomly. The return value of this function is an array of offers, where each offer consists of number of stops, airline name, airline ICAO code, list of cities through which the route passes, and the price. Price is estimated based on the airline's cost category and distance between airports.

** HTTP requests
    To communicate with client, Express.js framework is used to handle various HTTP requests. In *express_server/index.js*, a couple of services are defined, used as API by the client. In this example, server process a GET request for plane offers, taking source and destination airport IDs as parameters. *db* is object containing all functions exported from *express_server/database.js*. If database responds without errors, client is transmitted the result together with status 200 (OK). If something goes wrong, client is informed with status 400 (Bad Request).
    #+begin_src js
app.get("/plane_offers/:source/:destination", async function(req, res) {
    console.log("/plane_offers" +req.params.source + " " + req.params.destination);
    let result = await db.getPlaneOffers(req.params.source, req.params.destination);
    if (result === false)
        res.status(400).send(result);
    else 
        res.status(200).send(result);
});
    #+end_src

    Here is a complete list of all backend API:

* Frontend
** Parent component
   React parent component is defined in *react_app/src/App.js*. It includes all child component files, routes to different pages, keeps global states, provides inter-page communication and even can make fetch requests to backend server. The way the application renders is defined in the return statement of the *App()* functional component:
   #+begin_src js
return (
    <div>
        <Router>
            <Header account_name={account_name}/>
            <Routes>
                <Route path='/' element={<Home/>}/>
                <Route path='/home' element={<Home/>}/>
                <Route path='/map' element=
                       {<Map onMarker1={(result) => {setAirport1(result)}} onMarker2={(result) => {setAirport2(result)}}/>}/>
                <Route path='/calculator' element=
                       {<Calculator origin={airport1} destination={airport2} user_credentials={user_credentials}/>}/>
                <Route path='/account' element=
                       {<Account user_data={user_data} user_credentials={user_credentials} onLogin={(result) => {setUserCredentials(result)}}/>}/>
            </Routes>
        </Router>
    </div>
);
   #+end_src
   The contents of Router tag are a static Header component, containing the navigation buttons, and a dynamic portion which is replaced by a page, based on URL. There a couple of states here. *account_name* state is passed to Header to render user's name, purely for design purposes. This state is updated every time Account component is triggered to update user credentials, on an *onLogin* event. *user_credentials* is a state on its own, shared between the Parent, Account, and Calculator components. Map component can update Parent's *airport1* and *airport2* states on marker change events. These states are needed for Calculator. In this design, map communicates the airport IDs to the calculator page by means of the Parent. Calculator also needs *user_credentials*, because it saves calculations to the database, and since it is private data, our backend would demand authentication.
** Header
    Header component resides *react_app/src/components/header.js*. It only renders navigation buttons and the website logo. On the *Account* button, text is changed from "Account" to the user's first name once logged in.
    #+begin_src js
    <img src={voyify_logo} />
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><NavLink className="button" to="home"><img/>Home</NavLink></li>
            <li><NavLink className="button" to="map"><img/>Map</NavLink></li>
            <li><NavLink className="button" to="calculator"><img/>Calculator</NavLink></li>
            <li><NavLink className="button" to="order"><img/>Order</NavLink></li>
            <li><NavLink className="button" to="admin"><img/>Admin</NavLink></li>
            <li><NavLink className="button_img" to="account"><img src={user_icon}/> {props.account_name}</NavLink></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    #+end_src

** Account
   Account page can be in one of two states: registration/login state or logged in state, where user's history can be examined. Account can make fetch requests to the backend API using the following methods:
    - registerSubmit(e)
    - loginSubmit(e)
    - deleteAccount()
    - getHistory()
    Here are screenshots of the Account page:
    [[./report/images/account.png]]
    [[./report/images/loggedin.png]]
** Map
 On the Map page, we have developed a frontend-centric interface. Turning our attention to the SQL side, we utilized the `closest_airport(p_lat double, p_long double)` function. This function takes latitude (`p_lat`) and longitude (`p_long`) as parameters and retrieves information from the `airports` table to find the closest airport to the specified location. The closest_airport(p_lat DOUBLE, p_long DOUBLE) and distance_between_airports(a INT, b INT) SQL functions are responsible for distance calculations between airports and finding the closest airport to a given geographical point. `distance_between_airports` calculates the distance between two airports based on their coordinates. `closest_airport` identifies the nearest airport to a specified latitude and longitude.

This React component uses Leaflet for mapping features. It provides an interactive map where users can set markers and visualize travel routes. The component uses state variables and effects for managing marker positions and fetching airport data.


  #+BEGIN_SRC jsx
  ; Event Handling - Marker Interaction
  const LocationFinderDummy = () => {
    const map = useMapEvents({
      click(e) {
        ; Marker setting logic...
      },
    });
    return null;
  };

  ; Data Fetching - closest_airport Function
  useEffect(() => {
    const data = { position: { lat: marker1[0], lng: marker1[1] } };
    fetch('http://localhost:8080/closest_airport', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    }).then(response => response.json()).then(data => {
      setData1(data);
      props.onMarker1(data["id"]);
      const marker = markerRef1.current;
      if (marker) {
        marker.openPopup();
      }
    });
  }, [marker1]);
  #+END_SRC

The event handling logic enables users to set markers on the map. The `LocationFinderDummy` component uses the `useMapEvents` hook to detect click events. Data fetching is demonstrated using the `closest_airport` function, which is triggered when the marker position changes.

** Calculator
   Calculator takes two airport ID numbers, and displays a list of possible flights with their corresponding airlines. In a horizontal scrolling menu, cards with all details, such as airline logos, airlines names, stops and price are displayed. Number of days can be entered here as well. In the bottom, there is a submit button, which saves the calculated result.
